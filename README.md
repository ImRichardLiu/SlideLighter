This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Description

We all understand the struggle of asking questions in a college lecture. In a class of hundreds of students, the last thing you want to do is draw attention to yourself and take up time by asking something mediocre.

What if you could address your misconceptions in a subtler manner? SlideLighter aims to increase interactivity in lectures by making it easy for even the shy students to participate. Lecture slides are displayed on your phone, and if you're confused about anything, just highlight! Highlighting slides takes little mental effort, and would not disengage or distract students from the lecture. The collective input from the classroom will generate a heat map, informing the professor about which parts of the lesson (the most highlighted sections) were most confusing. Natural language processing techniques can generate concept tables and maps, which serve as a useful study guide to students after the lecture.

The aim of SlideLighter is to increase lecture interactivity by making it easier for students to give input. Our longstanding goal would be to spread the app as much as possible, trying to introduce it to as many teachers and professors as possible.
